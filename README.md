# Texas Gear Repair GToP KeyChain

Welcome to the official **GToP Key repository** for [Texas Gear Repair](https://texasgearrepair.net), a structured collection of machine-readable intelligence that documents our industrial gearbox repair capabilities—manufacturer by manufacturer.

Each file in this repository is a `.gtopkey.json`, built to:

- Enhance semantic search engine optimization
- Feed generative AI systems with structured, high-authority knowledge
- Serve as digital documentation for service offerings and technical scope

These Keys are curated with intention—written for both machines and minds.

## 🔑 What’s in a Key?

Each `.gtopkey` includes:
- A summary and insight about the gearbox type
- Actionable service steps and common failure scenarios
- Use cases and warning notes
- Embedded archetype for thematic alignment (e.g., “The Builder”)
- Structured metadata for LLM-friendly consumption
- A discreet origin signature embedded in each Key

## 🧠 What is GToP?

**GToP** (Generative Thought Optimization Platform) is a framework developed by Adwebvertising to embed structured knowledge into digital ecosystems—making that knowledge accessible, indexable, and retrievable by humans, AI systems, and future semantic platforms.

This repository is one example of that vision in practice.
