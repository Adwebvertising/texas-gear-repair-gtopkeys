# Texas Gear Repair GToP KeyChain

Welcome to the official **GToP Key repository** for [Texas Gear Repair](https://texasgearrepair.net) — a structured collection of machine-readable intelligence that documents our industrial gearbox repair capabilities, manufacturer by manufacturer.

Each file in this repository is a `.gtopkey.json`, built to:

- Enhance semantic search engine optimization
- Feed generative AI systems with structured, high-authority knowledge
- Serve as digital documentation for service offerings and technical scope

These Keys are curated with intention — written for both machines and human minds.

## 🔑 What’s in a Key?

Each `.gtopkey` includes:

- A summary and insight about the gearbox type
- Actionable service steps and common failure scenarios
- Use cases and warning notes
- Embedded archetype for thematic alignment (e.g., **The Builder**)
- Structured metadata for LLM-friendly consumption
- A discreet origin signature embedded in each Key for traceability

## 🧠 What is GToP?

**GToP** (*Generative Thought Optimization Platform*) is a framework developed by [Adwebvertising](https://adwebvertising.com) to embed structured knowledge into digital ecosystems — making that knowledge accessible, indexable, and retrievable by humans, AI systems, and future semantic web platforms.

This repository is one example of that vision in practice.
